I recently participated in [Protohype Pittsburgh](http://www.ctsi.pitt.edu/funding-innovation-protohype.html), an engineering and design competition organized by [Tech Shop Pittsburgh](http://www.techshop.ws/pittsburgh.html) and the University of Pittsburgh's [Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute (CTSI)](http://www.ctsi.pitt.edu/).
Along with a few of my coworkers from [DSA](http://dsautomation.com/) and a biomedical research team at Pitt, we designed and built a product prototype for entry into this friendly outside-of-work competition.
Our product was an automatic calibration system for physical therapy motion tracking units.

It was a fantastic experience - a chance to showcase my professional skills, meet a great group of researchers and makers in the Pittsburgh area, put together a neat and potentially impactful product, all with a pretty sweet return on the investment - a year membership and classes at Tech Shop Pittsburgh.
The details follow, and there's a lot - it's the first chance I've had to really pull everything together and summarize the completed project, so I went for it here.

## The ProtoHype Competition

Tech Shop Pittsburgh and CTSI teamed up to organize the ProtoHype competition, with the idea of combining CTSI's understanding of what needs there are in the medical field, and Tech Shop Pittsburgh's extensive local facility for design and fabrication, and their maker-minded membership base.
The idea is that teams at the CTSI would propose problem statements in the field of biomedicine.
They would then pair with a team of Tech Shop members to create a prototype product to address that need.
After prototypes were built, they would be presented and judged by Tech Shop and CTSI staff for technical merit, ability for commercialization, and potential benefit to patients/outpatients or other users.

## Our Challenge

We worked with Dr. Kevin Bell and his group in the University of Pittsburgh bioengineering department, including Marcus Allen and Chukwudi Onyeukwu.
They work with precision motion capture units (accelerometers, magnetometers, and gyroscopes) combined into an IMU, or intertial measurement unit, that allow precise characterization of patients body movements during physical therapy.
These help doctors and patients ensure they are performing exercises correctly, but the devices are difficult to calibrate - thus the need for an automated calibration procedure.

Here's Dr. Bell's team's own statement of the problem, posted early in the Protohype competition;

We responded at the pairing phase with a pitch for our expertise at solving this sort of automation problem, and our proposed attack on a solution.
Here's Tim Nolan, our team lead;

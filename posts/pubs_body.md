## Teaching

I've always found teaching rewarding, not least because between preparation and discussion and insightful questions, I often learn just as much as my students do in the process.
Below are some course topics I've taught as a [Certified Professional Instructor](http://sine.ni.com/nips/cds/view/p/lang/en/nid/10641) with National Instruments through DSA (my current workplace);

* Data Acquisition and Signal Condition
* Machine Vision
* NI LabVIEW Core 1, Core 2, Core 3, and LabVIEW Connectivity - the standard sequence of  courses created by National Instruments on LabVIEW development
* NI LabWINDOWS CVI Core 1 and 2 - two courses offered by NI in C Programming
* Managing Software Engineering in LabVIEW - a course covering software engineering concepts and practices, such as source code control, issue tracking, software development lifecycle

I taught or TA'd these classes in the undergraduate Physics department at Carnegie Mellon;

* Matter and Interactions II (33-132)
* Physics II for Engineering Students (33-107)
* Energy and Environmental Issues (33-115), a general-audience course covering the physics behind energy consumption and generation, and its impact on our world

In addition to those courses, I have also worked as a teacher and mentor for younger students, including at

* <p>Carnegie Mellon's [SAMS Program](https://admission.enrollment.cmu.edu/pages/diversity-sams) for high school students from groups traditionally underrepresented or underserved in STEM fields, and</p>
* <p>[Summerbridge Pittsburgh](https://www.sewickley.org/page/summerbridge), a summer educational enrichment program for at-risk Pittsburgh middle school students</p>
